Today, I introduce **my open source project** `Hain`.
If you find an `Alfred` alternative for Windows (actually it works on macOS too), you should try it.
This is made by JavaScript. and you can make plugins with JavaScript easily.

It's pretty inactive project for now, but it works well!
it's very hard to maintain the project by myself.

Thanks!
