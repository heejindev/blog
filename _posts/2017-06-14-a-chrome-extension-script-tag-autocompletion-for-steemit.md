Currently, Steemit has no support for **tag autocompletion** when you write an story.
It is inconvenient. so I made a small extension script for Steemit.
You can use tag autocompletion after installing the script like the above image.

  
Here's how to install:
## 1. Install Tampermonkey
You need to install `Tampermonkey` before using my script.
`Tampermonkey` is very popular chrome extension that allows users to customize the site.

[Install Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)


## 2. Install the Script
After installing `Tampermonkey`, you can install the script by clicking the link below.

[Install the Script](https://gist.github.com/appetizermonster/0f95597f1ad71b1668bc44812502605c/raw/steemit-helper.user.js)

## 3. All done
Now, you can use the full power of the script.
